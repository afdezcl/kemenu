Acto seguido podrá iniciar sesión y comenzar a crear su menú digital o subir una imagen de la carta. En este momento KEMENU te proporcionará el código QR que podrás guardar e imprimir para dejarlo por su restaurante."

      "question": "¿Cómo pueden ver los clientes la carta en su móvil?",
      "answer": "Cuando tengas el código QR repartido por tu restaurante, los clientes solo tendrán que abrir la cámara de su móvil y enfocar al código QR, acto seguido les aparecerá un enlace con la carta de tu restaurante. Si no funcionase con la cámara del móvil, recomendamos descargar alguna aplicación gratuita de lector de QR, ya que móviles de años anteriores no permiten leer el código QR directamente desde la cámara."
